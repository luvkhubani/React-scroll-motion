# React-scroll-motion
This is a small test project inorder to learn Scroll motion in react, in the project you will observe FadeAnimation, ZoomAnimation, MoveAnimation, and StickyAnimation. Also I have learned this from Seonghyeok Chun's Scroll animation video.

I have also attached a screen recording of how does the scroll motion looks like.
